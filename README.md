Various Machine Learning Talks
===========================

So far only includes Introduction to Machine Learning:

>This talk will introduce the audience to machine learning techniques and algorithms through an example of a classifier that can predict an animal’s species as canine or feline based on a simple set of features. Three very different algorithms are introduced, Naïve Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks and  Random Forests. These three algorithms provide a good starting point for most classification problems. The performance and accuracy of the three algorithms is compared and suggestions for future work on the classifier is suggested.
